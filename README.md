# Database Systems Coursework

Task: create a simple managing system for a small library using SQL Database.

## Setup

1. `npm run all:install` - will install all dependencies.
2. `npm run start` - will build the client, copy the build to server/public and start the server.
3. `npm run watch` - will start development servers for both the server and the client.
4. `npm run server:start` - will start the server.
5. You can find other scripts inside package.json, but these should suffice.
